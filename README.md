# Portfolio – Backend & Data Engineer

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The site is intentionally designed to be **clean, fast, and engineering-focused**, highlighting my experience in **backend systems, data engineering, cloud-native architectures, and production ML deployments**.

The portfolio is live and will evolve incrementally as system case studies and projects are completed.
